# STM32F103 Comfortblinker
The STM32F103 Comfortblinker project is a microcontroller-based solution designed to create a comfortable blinking animation using LEDs. 
The project utilizes two buttons that act in different directions to initiate the animation. 
The program is built with modules and includes unit tests to ensure its functionality.

# Features
- **Blinking Animation:** Initiates a comfortable blinking animation using LEDs.
- **Two-Button Control:** Uses two buttons that act in different directions to start the animation.
- **State Machines:** Utilizes two state machines to control the animation.
- **Module-Based Programming:** Built with modules for easy modification and maintenance.
- **Unit Tests:** Includes unit tests to ensure the program's functionality.
# Components
1. **Hardware**
Responsible for controlling the LEDs and receiving input from the buttons.

- **STM32F103 Microcontroller:** Interfaces with the LEDs and buttons to control the animation.
- **LEDs:** Five LEDs that turn on and off in a row to create the blinking animation.
- **Buttons:** Two buttons that act in different directions to initiate the animation.
# 2. Software
Responsible for controlling the hardware components and creating the blinking animation.

- **State Machines:** Utilizes two state machines to control the animation.
- **Module-Based Programming:** Built with modules for easy modification and maintenance.
- **Unit Tests:** Includes unit tests to ensure the program's functionality.
